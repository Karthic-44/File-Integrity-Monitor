# File Integrity Monitor

This project is aimed at safeguarding the integrity of a computer's files and data. 
It ensures that the data present in a computer is reliable and is unaltered from its original form. 
Operating in real-time, it continuously monitors and analyzes cryptographic hash values of files, promptly detecting any unauthorized or unintended changes. 
The primary goal is to prevent and identify both accidental alterations, such as those resulting from software updates, and malicious tampering by external actors. 
By comparing hash values over time. It provides immediate visibility into file modifications, allowing swift responses to potential security incidents. 
It also ensures the trustworthiness of the system, minimizing the impact of security breaches and contributing to a robust cybersecurity posture.
